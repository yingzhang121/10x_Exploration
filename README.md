# 10x Exploration
======

### 10x introduction:
10x technology is a method that can sequence a large number of single cells in batch.
The basics of 10x technology is to use a two-barcode system to label each molecule. 
The first barcode is called cell barcode, and the second barcode is called UMI (unique molecule identifier).

The major demultiplex algorithm is wrapped into a software package, called cellranger.
From the website:
> Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell RNA-seq output to align reads, 
> generate gene-cell matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis.

*This repository is for a few scripts I wrote for the exploration of 10x data.*
